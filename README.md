yay I added sprites 😁

## What's the purpose of this project?
Maybe I would create a level creator from portal2ds, or maybe even the WHOLE GAME... But at this moment, I don't have any plans for it. Just a small project, where I discover libnds and easy gl2d.

## Controls
- Left - go left
- Right - go right
- A - jump
- X - create blue portal
- Y - create orange portal
