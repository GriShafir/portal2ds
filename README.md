**portal2ds** is an open-source Portal game in 2D made for Nintendo DS(i).

## What's the purpose of this project?
Maybe I would create a level creator from portal2ds, or maybe even the WHOLE GAME... But at this moment, I don't have any plans for it. Just a small project, where I discover libnds and Easy GL2D.

## Compiling
1. Make sure you have installed devkitPro pacman. If not, go here ‚Äî https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started
2. Download the repository code's .zip archive and extract it anywhere you want.
3. In the extracted folder, there should be a file named `compile.bat`. Launch it. If you cannot launch the file due to different OS, then open command prompt in the folder, write "make" and press Enter. This should make both .nds and .elf files.
4. ???
5. Profit!
